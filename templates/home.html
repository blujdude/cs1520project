              <h4>About Dungeons & Dragons</h4>
              <p>The first Dungeons & Dragons game was played back when Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson chose to personalize the massive battles of their fantasy wargames with the exploits of individual heroes. This inspiration became the first fantasy roleplaying game, in which players are characters in an ongoing fantasy story. This new kind of game has become immensely popular over the years, and D&D has grown to include many new ways to vividly experience worlds of heroic fantasy.
              </p>
              <p>
              The core of D&D is storytelling. You and your friends tell a story together, guiding your heroes through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, courtly intrigue, and much more. You can also explore the world of Dungeons & Dragons through any of the novels written by its fantasy authors, as well as engaging board games and immersive video games. All of these stories are part of D&D.

                <p class="description">The trumpet is widely known for drawing in more extroverted children. They can be bold, brash, have nervous energy and even tend to be dominant and ambitious. This is due to the nature of the trumpet, which is usually a lead instrument playing a higher melody. Other experts say that children with good hand-eye coordination will do well with the trumpet, adding that most trumpet players are also good at video games. </p>

                <p class="description">The lyric baritone is a sweeter, milder sounding baritone voice, lacking in harshness; lighter and perhaps mellower than the dramatic baritone with a higher tessitura. Its common range is from the A below C3 to the G above middle C (A2 to G4). It is typically assigned to comic roles.</p>

It is also good to start young as developing the type of flexibility needed to play can be awkward for someone who is older. Although it is a great starter instrument, keep in mind that experts say quietly behaved children who are happy to be a part of a whole, not needing to stand out and be heard, generally excel with a violin. </p>

                <p class="description">Experts are a bit divided when it comes to the personality type best suited for playing the flute. Some say that shy, lonely children who like privacy would enjoy playing the flute. While others say they tend to look for the talkative, smiley child who wants to be the center of attention. When considering physical characteristics for the flute, one expert mentioned looking for someone who used to be a swimmer and can take in a lot of air. </p>
